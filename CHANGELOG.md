# Moo changelog

## 1.0.3 — unreleased

### Added

- Google Drive: reopen recent, starred and shared files, search file names and browse folders with read-only metadata access. Configure it in Settings → Google; existing accounts reconnect to approve Drive access.
- Subscriptions: track renewals, trials, cancellation deadlines and costs by currency, with local storage, Backups and a searchable service-logo catalogue.

### Changed

- Google widgets: choose Mail, Calendar, Tasks or Drive in a 2×2 Widget settings selector. Drive remembers its selected view, loads more files at the scroll boundary, and sizes its list to Files per page. Its header keeps Refresh as its only action.

## 1.0.2 — 9 November 2026; updated 10 November 2026

### Added

- Planning: capture personal tasks for Today, Tomorrow or Later, type dates such as “tomorrow” and “in 3 days”, choose three daily priorities, estimate time and review unfinished plans. Tasks stay local, work offline and are included in Backups.
- Widget layout: place widgets in the upper-left and upper-right corners as well as the lower corners and centre. Upper-right widgets appear above the navbar buttons.
- Navbar: choose Classic or Glass styling for the navbar buttons in Settings → Navbar.

### Changed

- Weather: new profiles and resets place the widget in the bottom-right corner. Saved placements are preserved, including the basic layout in narrow windows.

### Fixed

- Widget layout: upper side cards and drop placeholders fill their Overview containers, lower side containers align with the preview bottom, and the navbar follows the upper-right stack as its height changes. Drag targets stay stable when lifting a widget, and a drag without a destination preserves placement.
- Weather: distinguish the built-in service as Default Provider at the top of the provider list, keeping OpenWeather for the API-key provider. Apply a typed location on Enter or when leaving the field, clear the old forecast and refresh the selected provider without reloading the page.

## 1.0.1 — 5 November 2026

### Fixed

- Google widgets: Natural Format moves a time without an explicit date to tomorrow when that time has already passed today. Google Mail now defaults to unread messages in the inbox. Overlapping Google sign-in flows are blocked with a clear message. Changing the Weather type loads its custom controls without breaking settings, and the wind speed switch now follows its selected state.
- Weather: the Classic surface keeps its rounded corners clean in Chrome.

### Changed

- GitHub remembers the last opened tab, marks newly discovered items with a count, and opens a tab with new items after a refresh. Split middle widget columns stay transparent between cards.

## 1.0.0 — 26 October 2026; rebuilt 5 November 2026

Moo is a personal fork of [Mue](https://github.com/mue/mue) for Firefox and Zen. New profiles and resets open in English with digital time, Search/Ask Bar, basic weather and Unsplash backgrounds. Enable other widgets in Settings. The 5 November rebuild includes the intervening feature and bug fixes and the shared Chrome build support. Selectable languages have complete key coverage, including machine-assisted translations that still need fluent-speaker review.

### Added

- Google widgets: read mail, manage tasks and check calendars using your own Google OAuth client. Calendar and Tasks accept English scheduling phrases with a review of the interpreted fields. Calendar adds recurring events, reminders, guests, attachments and a scrollable event preview with on-demand location maps. Background reminders use optional notification access. [Calendar](docs/GOOGLE-CALENDAR.md) · [Natural Format](docs/NATURAL-FORMAT.md).
- Search/Ask Bar: choose a search engine, AI service or reference site for a query. The menu remains available in smaller windows.
- Picture, video and live backgrounds: choose a source, upload pictures or add streams. Triple-click a playing video to hide the widgets; Escape restores them. Media cleanup and storage tests cover decoder sources, HLS players, subscriptions and asset lifetimes. The memory test runner uses a disposable browser profile. [Memory testing and limits](docs/MEMORY-TESTING.md).
- Widget layout: save separate Standard and Focus layouts, move widgets between columns and choose their panel styles. Focus sessions and Progress clock shifts activate the Focus layout. Bookmarks combines browser bookmarks, Raindrop and Readwise with shared previews and reading selections; Habits tracks confirmed days, streaks and milestones; GitHub shows review requests, issues, pull requests and workflow runs. [Bookmarks](docs/BOOKMARKS.md) · [Habits and GitHub](docs/HABITS-AIR-QUALITY-GITHUB.md).
- Clock and weather: choose clocks, world clocks, working hours and a five-day forecast. Air Quality shows European or US AQI with optional forecasts, pollutants, UV and pollen in Basic, Summary or Detailed views. [Time features](docs/TIME-AND-COUNTDOWNS.md).
- RSS reader: read feeds or connect Feedly, preview stories, and import or export OPML while preserving folders. Feedly reads use its unread list, mark opened stories read and report token usage in Settings.
- Floats and Quick Links: create floating notes, lists, images and countdowns, keep selected items fixed and choose which appear in Focus. Notes have an editor; countdown titles can be edited directly. Quick Links supports separate Focus/Work destinations and optional usage ordering while preserving manual order by default.
- Backups and browser development: export and preview imports of settings and uploaded pictures while keeping credentials separate. Both repositories build Firefox and Chrome from the same application and permission catalogue, with parity guidance and a sync check. Chrome uses a Manifest V3 service worker and its own Google OAuth redirect. README hero and preview assets are reused. [Firefox and Chrome development](docs/CROSS-BROWSER.md).

### Changed

### Removed

- From Mue: the setup wizard, Marketplace and Library, quotes and greetings, achievements, the old search widget, the message form, and the About sections for support, contributors, supporters, photographers and curators. Search/Ask Bar provides current search options. Old Persian, Egyptian Arabic and South Azerbaijani were removed from the selector because their translations are incomplete.
