Moo 1.0.2 for Firefox adds Planning and updates Widget layout, Navbar styling and Weather settings.

- Planning: make a personal daily plan with Today, Tomorrow and Later lists, up to three priorities, notes and optional time estimates. Type dates in English, such as “Call Mum tomorrow” or “Book tickets in 3 days”, with a preview before adding. Review unfinished tasks, keep completion history, and undo individual deletions. Plans work offline, are included in Backups, and support Classic/Glass styling and separate Focus visibility. Enable it in Settings → Planning.
- Widget layout: use all four corners and the centre. Side cards and drop placeholders fill their Overview containers, and the lower side containers align with the preview bottom. Upper-right widgets appear above Focus and Settings; the buttons follow the stack as its height changes. Drag targets remain stable, and a drag without a destination preserves placement.
- Navbar: choose Classic or Glass button styling in Settings → Navbar. The choice applies immediately and survives reloads and backups.
- Weather: new profiles and resets place Weather in the bottom-right, while saved placements are preserved. Apply a typed location on Enter or when leaving the field without reloading the page. Default Provider appears first in the provider list; OpenWeather identifies the separate API-key provider.

Packaged extensions were checked in Firefox and Chrome for Planning capture and editing, date parsing, priorities, completion, deletion/undo, history cleanup, concurrent edits, keyboard use, Focus placement, layout, style changes, persistence and narrow windows. The Sofia location flow used mocked OpenWeather responses; live API-key behavior remains unverified. Tests, lint, both browser builds, package validators and shared-file parity checks pass.

The Firefox archive is unsigned and supports temporary installation through about:debugging. It is not a Mozilla-signed release.
